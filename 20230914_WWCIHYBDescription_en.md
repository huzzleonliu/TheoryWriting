## Background of Creation

Approximately seven or eight years ago, a friend of mine told me a story. We were walking down a path near our school on a spring afternoon, and he pointed at the willow seeds covered ground in drifting , asking me:

"Do you know? These white things are actually a virus. It enters your body through your respiratory system, and do you know what happens next?"

I knew it was just casual chit-chat, so I played along, saying:

"Yes, I'll gradually lose consciousness, climb up to the tallest building, and then a mushroom will grow on my head, spreading spores to others."

"No, your immune system will devour it, and nothing will happen," he replied.



Such a mundane ending might seem excessively dull even in the context of everyday chit-chat. However, when you think about it, the significance of this conversation appears to align with its form. Those things that seem heart-pounding or those we place great expectations on often lack an absolute reason for existence. In every moment we can consciously perceive, there is the birth and death of things, with no inherent, justified existence. Beautiful things may come into existence and pass away without ever being acknowledged by us. Just like how, several years later, when I mentioned this conversation to my classmate, he had completely forgotten it.

For the same reason, we cannot prevent the disappearance of people around us or even our own disappearance, and we cannot determine the rate at which we vanish. When I stood in front of the mirror after taking a shower, I realized clearly that my body that day was probably the most vibrant it would ever be in my lifetime. Just as every day after the summer solstice grows shorter, in the future, I will face a gradual loss of vitality, akin to a mountain that slowly erodes with little chance of regrowth. This desperate helplessness isn't limited to my lack of control over the rhythm of my life; it also extends to my relationships with others.

In this age, we no longer truly need to be recognized or to recognize others. People around us are like the lights of a big city, some shining brightly, some dimming. Consequently, we lose our names and are left with only our names, not remembered by anyone, not remembering the names of others, not cared for, and not caring about others. Because of this, our disappearance doesn't have much impact on others. We look at the people around us, as well as ourselves, as if anticipating this inevitable event. So, we really do disappear.

In our rapidly changing society, we can no longer firmly position ourselves within it. We can't know the role we play in the long history of social development, the meaning our work truly holds, or where the value of our work or creations ultimately resides, and in what historical context they contribute. Amidst this uncertainty, our existence becomes blurred, and vanishing and existing seem equally inconsequential. Even the most sudden disappearance doesn't cause much of a ripple. Perhaps, in this sense, we never really existed, and there's no need to lament our disappearance.



But, how do we face our own disappearance? Can we truly accept it? I had a dream about it once. In the dream, I found myself in my mother's office from my childhood, surrounded by her familiar coworkers. I tried to greet them, but they couldn't hear my voice. My body passed through theirs, and I knew I was becoming "shallow," gradually losing substance. In the dream, I understood that death was even scarier. As my vision blurred and I couldn't hear or see anything, even the inability to perceive that I couldn't perceive became imperceptible. It was like a mural against a black background, starting somewhere, where all strokes disappeared, turning into an entirely black wall. Even the "black" itself was a metaphor, something imperceptible, and genuine black couldn't be perceived. Can we truly face ourselves becoming "shallow" to the point of disappearing?

For this reason, I can't stop imagining a version of myself deteriorating continuously. My body decaying, disintegrating, becoming emaciated, like a walking corpse, with only bones left. For me, this kind of body is real, detached from fantasy. In ancient Chinese history, countless emperors sought to extend their lives through various medicines and rare materials, only to trade their lifespan for a temporary burst of vitality, crafting illusions of eternal life. I don't want to have such illusions. I want to face my vulnerability, ugliness, and aging with the same seriousness as the character in "To Live." So, I created a metal sculpture—a figure inside, head bowed, worn down, standing weakly yet resolutely. To me, this is the ideal posture for life: battered, old, and frail, yet standing resolute, unwavering, and confronting destiny. Romain Rolland said, "There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is and to love it." I firmly believe in this.

Standing alone isn't enough; standing is static, and a person's spirit cannot remain static. Among my many notions of heroism, there's one image that aligns with my fantasy of an active individual, and it's the figure of the 'Traveler' that appears at the 24th second of the opening CG in 'Dark Souls III.' 'Walking' is the imagery Giacometti bestowed upon me. If there's one paradigm symbolizing an active person, it should be walking, moving forward towards the direction their soul desires. Ancient wisdom says, 'The correct path in the world is full of vicissitudes（人间正道是沧桑）,' where 'vicissitudes（沧桑）' comes from the phrase 'the sea turns into mulberry fields,' signifying 'the tremendous change and the long time it takes for the world to transform.' I think this kind of walking is akin to the essence of 'vicissitudes.' Walk on until you've exhausted yourself. In my two already damaged oil clay sculptures, I used this intention. One depicts a moment of weary walking, the body curling into a bowl shape as it progresses. The other portrays two worn-out figures supporting each other, and in the month following the completion of this work, they gradually lean forward and collapse. I believe this is the fate of a traveller, or perhaps, the fate of "my hero."

In our age, staying still is a luxury none of us can afford. Nobody truly stays still, but the question is, in which direction do we walk? A talk show quoted a monk's words, "Young people today chase after trends, follow one star, then another TV series, just as if they would never die." Now, everything seems back to the beginning. If death is inevitable, and we must do something to confront it, what do we do? What do we use to combat our own disappearance? What attitude do we choose? What do we leave behind?



As I researched at the Yungang Grottoes, I saw the responses of our predecessors to this eternal question. Indeed, the towering, magnificent stone statues symbolised the ancient people's aspirations for a better life beyond, but I paid attention to a more sincere, smaller response. Next to these massive stone statues, nearly every corner bore the imprints of our predecessors. Some were marks left by tourists, some were hearts engraved by lovers, and some were prayers for family. These seemingly insignificant desires were often viewed as "vandalism" and were reluctantly protected by acrylic glass by the staff tasked with preserving the giant Buddhas. In my view, these inscriptions are even more devout, just smaller in scale. If the Buddha is as compassionate and understanding as we imagine, I think he would listen to these modest wishes carefully. So, I took photos of these small imprints. Some of the marks' owners have likely passed away, but if they knew that the small traces they left behind were preserved in the form of pictures, as their continuation in this world, I believe they would find solace.

As I write these words today, I have lived in Fantoft, Bergen, for nearly five years. Fantoft is a dormitory area specifically for students, so every year, exchange students from various countries come and go. My closest relationships are naturally with the exchange students from China. Initially, we shared experiences of the city and the country. Later, I began to provide them with practical help, assisting them in their student lives here. Over the past decade, I've crossed paths with ten batches of exchange students. Each semester, we would gather for parties, experiencing moments of joy and sharing moments of sorrow. Then, they would return to their countries, disappearing from my life. When I walked the familiar streets and reminisced about the moments we spent together, I wished to hold onto them, but I struggled even to retain the memories of our time together.

In my moments of upset, I walked to Steve's small chapel on the hill behind Fantoft. Here, I rediscovered the profound sense of awe I once felt at the Yungang Grottoes. Similarly, it's a tourist attraction, symbolizing sacred religion, and similarly, countless people have come and gone, leaving their marks on the trees in the chapel's adjacent woods. Within these countless marks lie the traces of the transient souls who once visited this place. They stored their past here. I can't distinguish whose imprints are whose, but I believe there might be traces left by my friends, just like those imprints that have existed for decades. Yes, I've lingered in this forest long enough, almost every time a friend left Bergen, I would come here for a while. As a form of healing, this forest contains many touching memories. I saw the names of a young man named Bjarte and a young woman named Kristin carefully carving romantic love stories into the trees in 1987. I saw a man named Wayn earnestly inscribing his name on a tree. Then, in 2012, I saw the same person, Svart Mika, after 30 years, returning to this forest, for the second time carving his name on another tree. In the past few decades, or even centuries, people have come and gone in this area, leaving fragments of their lives within this forest. People come and go, much like stars, brightly flickering, countless stories happening, repeating here, and then fading into oblivion. However, this land remains unchanged. It does its best to remember every earnest dream and desire, despite many marks being lost and memories fading with time.

I believe that this forest holds the light emitted by generations upon generations, by people of different virtues and vices, wit and folly, but none are devoid of the radiance of being human. In the twinkle of lights coming and going, there are endless joys and disappointments, steadfastness and regrets. These sincere sentiments are the most vivid existence for me. They may be small, but if you concentrate your attention on a candle, you will surely see the brilliant halo, much like the sun. Now, let's go back to the beginning: If death is inevitable, and we must do something to confront it, what do we do? What do we use to combat our own disappearance? What attitude do we choose? What do we leave behind? And me, With What Can I Hold You Back?



## With What Can I Hold You Back

"With What Can I Hold You Back" is one of the art projects under my "Temple Project", among four sub-projects. This project is focused on seeking the continuation of finite human lives, attempting to present the tiny and blurred memories found in unnoticed corners of life. It aims to imagine the vivid life force that ordinary, overlooked individuals reveal in moments of sincerity.

Based on this concept, this work has no specific material constraints or size definitions. Currently, I have created a series of rubbings based on imprints found in the Fantoft forest. The ultimate narrative takes place in the hearts of the audience. They will construct their own stories based on the information they read, completing their narrative. Therefore, I hope to present the fragmented and blurry rubbings to the audience, allowing visitors to explore and imagine their own stories as they visit.

## Creative Plan

I hope to realize this digital art project in the Fantoft forest by using AR (Augmented Reality) technology provided by Blipbuilder. This will open another layer of exhibition space within the forest. Visitors can immerse themselves in the forest, observe the rubbings on the trees around them, and engage with a series of questions. Through this, they can imagine the stories behind each rubbing. This serves as an opportunity to glimpse into the vibrant lives hidden behind the traces in the trees.
